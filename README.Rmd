# Linearity

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Linearity is to check if three given vectors, that are of the same length, are linearly independent. If they are independent, the function returns true, otherwise false.

This package consists of one single function, lin_indep_threevectors. 

We used `use_r`, `load_all()` and `use_readme_rmd()` from `devtools` to create the files in the package.
We used `use_testthat()` , `use_test("lin_indep_threevectors")` and `test()` from `usethis` to create a test file for the function lin_indep_threevectors. 

We wrote the function `lin_indep_threevectors` manually.


## Installation

You can install the released version of Linearity from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("Linearity")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sezar543/Linearity")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Linearity)
lin_indep_threevectors(c(2,1,1),c(3,2,1),c(5,5,6))
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
